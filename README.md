Squad Timer
================
Squad Timer helps you keep track of vehicle respawn timers. Very helpful if you want to know if the enemy MBT has already respawned.

Use: <https://squadtimer.todo>.


## Development
1. Run `git update-index --skip-worktree src/environments/environment.ts`  
   This prevents git from registering changes to the file.
1. Edit `src/environments/environment.ts` as your development environment requires.
1. Run `yarn run start`. The app will be on <http://localhost:4250>.
